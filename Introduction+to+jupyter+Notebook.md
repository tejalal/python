# Introduction to Jupyter Notebook

## The Jupyter Notebook
- The Jupyter Notebook is an open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and narrative text. 
- Uses include: data cleaning and transformation, numerical simulation, statistical modeling, data visualization, machine learning, and much more.
- Python Programs can be created in Jupyter Notebook

## How to open Jupyter Notebook
#### Windows:
- Open Anaconda Prompt (Go to start and type Anaconda) and type "jupyter notebook" and press enter

#### Linix(Ubuntu):


When you open Jupyter for the first time it will look like

Your newly opened Python Notebook will look like:

### Points to remember about Python Jupyter Notebook

- A Notebook can have many cells
- We write Python code inside the cells
- One Python program can be split over multiple cells in Notebook
- We can add another cell by clicking on the + (plus) button.
- We can delete, rearrange the order of the cells
- To run any python code written into the cell just press Shift+Enter or Control+Enter OR
- We can also click on the run button next to the down arrow
- We can restart or interrupt the Python Kernel by going to the Kernel menu

#### Here is the short description with image to beter understand the Jupyter environment

## Cell Type:
The Notebook can have several types of cells

### Code
Cell type should be code when writing Python code, It can be seen from above images that the default cell type is code.
### Markdown
- Cell type should be Markdown when we do not want Python Interpreter to treat our content as a Python code.
- Generally it is used for documentation, If cell type is Markdown then it will be treated as a normal text
- We can use several formatting to decorate and organize out content in Markdown
- The example of markdown is shown below

When you run above cell the content will look like

### We can have many Code and Markdown cells in Notebook in any order we want.
### This page content has been created in Jupyter Notebook using different Markdown cells
